### better-than-a-spreadsheet (under development)

- intended to be integrated into POSM as a module
- primary/initial use case is for simplified beneficiary list management
  - storing everything in a database (SQLite) will allow for an automated pull process from data collected via ODK Collect, instead of a regular download of the data-to-date as a CSV and manually copy/pasting new rows into your master spreadsheet
  - GUI should make the whole process easy for someone who is not techy
